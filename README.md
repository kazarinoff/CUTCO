# CUTCO
College and University Transfer Coursebook of Oregon

This site is a central hub for course transfer information for students, faculty, and administrators. It includes multi-tiered models to establish permissions for teachers on different campuses with differing roles, CRUD operations depending on those roles, and an administrative dashboard to manage user access. Most importantly it serves as a quick and useful reference for students.
